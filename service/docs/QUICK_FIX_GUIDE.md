# 🚀 QUICK START - Fixed Repository

## ✅ All Import Issues FIXED!

### Run the Service (READY NOW)
```powershell
cd c:\Users\NathanDesk\Desktop\IRIS-Detection-Service\service
python -m src.controller
```

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Import errors | ✅ FIXED - All modules use relative imports now |
| BLE device name mismatch | ✅ FIXED - Changed to "AntiSleep-Glasses-ESP32" |
| Missing baseline | ✅ FIXED - Created at `service/src/drowsiness_baseline.json` |
| Package structure | ✅ FIXED - All modules importable |

---

## 📋 Expected Output

When you run the service, you should see:

```
INFO:root:Controller started.
INFO:root:Scanning for BLE device 'AntiSleep-Glasses-ESP32'...
```

**If BLE device is ON and nearby:**
```
INFO:root:Found device AntiSleep-Glasses-ESP32 @ XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
INFO:root:Connected to peripheral.
INFO:root:Subscribed to notifications...
INFO:websockets.server:server listening on localhost:8765
```

**If device not found:**
```
WARNING:root:Device not found, retrying in 2s...
```

## ⚠️ Bluetooth Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found?

1. **Check ESP32 is powered ON**
   ```
   - LED should be blinking (if you have status LED)
   - Upload transmitter_doc.ino if not already uploaded
   ```

2. **Check Windows Bluetooth**
   ```powershell
   # Open Settings > Bluetooth
   # Look for "AntiSleep-Glasses-ESP32"
   ```

3. **Verify device name in Arduino code**
   - Open `transmitter_doc.ino` line 23
   - Should say: `const char* BLE_NAME = "AntiSleep-Glasses-ESP32";`
   - If different, update `service/src/config.py` line 2 to match
